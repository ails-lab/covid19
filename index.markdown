News and resources related to the ongoing research on COVID-19 at the [Artificial Intelligence and Learning Systems Laboratory](https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/){:target="_blank"} (AILS) of the [ECE School](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en){:target="_blank"}, [NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr/en/){:target="_blank"}.

The AILS lab created this site initially as a data repository for the postgraduate course ["Advanced Data Science and Data Analytics" (CS708)]({{site.url | append: site.baseurl | append: "/cs708"}}). In the current academic year, the course focuses exclusively on COVID-19.

At the same time, numerous other AILS research teams are pursuing COVID-19 projects. Therefore, the site aims to become a hub for publishing results and news of all AILS activity regarding COVID-19.

Please browse our [Datasets and Resources]({{site.url | append: site.baseurl | append: "/data"}}) page.

Please feel free to [contact us](mailto:covid19@ails.ece.ntua.gr) to include your research outcomes.
