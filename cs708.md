## Advanced Data Science and Data Analytics

Postgraduate ECE course "Advanced Data Science and Data Analytics"  (CS708) tackles current challenges in processing and learning from big data.

The course started in the academic year 2015 - 2016, and you can find its [regular syllabus](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/doctoral/courses/708){:target="_blank"} at its official school page.

For the current academic year,  exceptionally, the course takes the form of a project class. We focus exclusively on Data Analytics / Data Science tasks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Projects

Potential research areas include:

1. Natural Language Processing
2. Social Networks
3. Bioinformatics
4. Epidemiological Data Analysis
5. Computer Vision
6. Financial Implications
7. Other (TBD)

Please consult our [COVID-19 datasets & resources page]({{site.url | append: site.baseurl | append: "/data"}}).

### Prerequisites

- Background in Machine Learning and Statistics
- Some Bioinformatics background is helpful but not required

### Staff
